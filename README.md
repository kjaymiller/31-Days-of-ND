# 31days of Neurodivergence (Site Edition)

<https://kjaymiller.com/>

## October is ADHD Awareness Month

In October 2022 I created a simple twitter campaign that shared a message of encouragement once a day!

This site allows you to view these messages.

## Tools

Flask
Azure Storage Queues
Azure Web Apps

### I want to add a message!

You can fill out a simple anonymous form to add a message to the queue.

This form asks questions about how you learned about your diagnosis. There is a plan to share this anonymous information in the future on the site to let others know how they can learn more about their diagnosis.

All information is anonymous by design. Any data revealing someones identity will be redacted.
